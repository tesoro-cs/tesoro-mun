Model United Nations is a program designed to simulate the international governing body, the United Nations. Over 20,000 student delegates worldwide interested in international relations and world events take the roles of foreign diplomats and represent their respective countries in a simulated session of a body of the United Nations. Thousands of high schools across the nation and universities such as Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and UC Berkeley hold conferences where issues are debated in committees, just like in the real United Nations. These committees, also known as intergovernmental organizations, include the the General Assembly, Economical and Social Council, the Counter-Terrorist Committee, the World Health Organization, the Security Council and more. Students focus on the issues that are actually debated in each respective committee, but altogether every type of world issue is discussed. Students actively engage in research, debate, and conflict resolution to develop solutions for real-life international problems.
